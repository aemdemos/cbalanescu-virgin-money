A credit card is a way to get \u2018credit\u2019 from a bank, or in more simple terms borrow money from a bank up to a set limit. You can use a credit card the same way you would use a debit card, but you\u2019ll need to remember to pay off the minimum amount each month by the set due date. With many credit cards you can also earn rewards or cashback on accepted purchases. How do credit cards work? A credit card gives you access to money (or \u2018credit\u2019) up to an agreed limit with your bank. You will receive a bill each month for what you have spent. As long as you pay the minimum amount required off before the due date each month, you will always have access up to your agreed credit limit. How does credit card interest work? The interest incurred on your credit card is charged when you "

Learn more about balance transfers How does a balance transfer affect the interest charge on my account? Once a balance transfer is processed on your Virgin Money Credit Card, here\u2019s what you need to know about interest rate charges: Many people choose to transfer their balance to take advantage of a 0% balance transfer interest rate \u2013 which means you don\u2019t pay any interest on that balance for a set period of time. But you should always check what the balance transfer interest rate is at the time you accept the offer. Keep in mind that you will still be charged interest on retail purchases while you have a balance transfer. This means any purchases you make will be charged interest at the purchase interest rate of the card you chose. At the end of the balance transfer period, the interest rate on any outstanding transferred balance and balance transfer fee will revert to the Annual Percentage Rate for Cash Advances. For example, if your balance transfer rate is 0 % p.a. for 12 months, during that 12 months all additional purchases will be charged interest at the Annual Percentage Rate for retail purchases. At the end of the 12 months, any outstanding balances from the Balance Transfer will revert to the Annual Percentage Rate for Cash Advances. Learn more about balance transfers How are my Velocity Points earned and transferred into my Velocity Frequent Flyer Account?
